# Automated Testing with Playwright

Playwright is used for integrated end-to-end (E2E) testing. We want to make sure that everything is still working as expected when we introduce changes.

This is only a first try and might not be worth it:
- Tests need to be run frequently, ideally in an automated way after every commit
- Tests need to be adapted when making changes to the functionality
- Tests should cover most of the website
- Tests can be quite complex when trying to solve puzzles or challenges with animated elements
